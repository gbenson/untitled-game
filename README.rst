Untitled game
=============

I'm just messing with ideas for now, there's nothing for you to play here.

Local setup
-----------

Clone the repo::

 git clone https://github.com/gbenson/untitled-game.git
 cd untitled-game

Create a virtual environment::

 python3 -m venv venv
 . venv/bin/activate

Upgrade pip and setuptools::

 pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

Install in editable mode::

 pip install -e .[dev]
